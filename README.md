# ASTEROIDS

... in space, which are not infringing on any copyright or anything because this is just a learning exercise.

## ABOUT

This is primarily a project for learning the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine, following the [Space Rocks! - A complete game in Godot Game Engine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsk-HSGFjnaGcjiD8y9-U_C0rB5kpDX5s) tutorial series on YouTube by Chris Bradfield (though with many deviations).

Artwork is from the Space Shooter Redux pack from [Kenney](http://www.kenney.nl) plus various bits and pieces I managed to cobble together using [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) image editor from Flying Meat. Background music is [SimpleBeat](http://opengameart.org/users/3uhox) from 3uhox on OpenGameArt.org.  Noises were created with [BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net).

Controls are WASD / cursor keys and space to fire, or you can use a controller. Be somewhere near the green zone at the start of the stage if you want to be safe!

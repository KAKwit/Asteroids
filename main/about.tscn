[color=gray]The starting point for this project was the excellent [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsk-HSGFjnaGcjiD8y9-U_C0rB5kpDX5s]Space Rocks! - A complete game in Godot Game Engine[/url] tutorial series on YouTube by Chris Bradfield (though this has subsequently diverged quite a bit).[/color]

[color=gray]Artwork is from the Space Shooter Redux pack from [url=www.kenney.nl]Kenney[/url] plus various bits and pieces I managed to cobble together using [url=https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/]Acorn[/url] image editor from Flying Meat. Planets from NASA.[/color]
